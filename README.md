Finds maps to play to improve your global rank on the scoresaber leaderboard/mod in the VR rythm game Beat Saber.
Just enter your username, click on the player suggestion that represents you and then click on the 'suggest' button. The tool will generate a list of maps that you could set a good score on.

It looks at other players around your rank, the maps they've gotten a good score on, judges them (rates things like player similarity, map popularity, skill difference) and compiles an ordered list of those players' top map plays that you haven't also gotten a top or recent score on.
